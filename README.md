# Goals

1. don't use so much electricity. our data structures should play to modern hardware's strengths.
1. don't surprise users with performance traps.
1. bring reliability techniques from academia into real-world practice.

# Architecture

Lock-free trees on a lock-free pagecache on a lock-free log. The pagecache scatters
partial page fragments across the log, rather than rewriting entire pages at a time
as B+ trees for spinning disks historically have. On page reads, we concurrently
scatter-gather reads across the log to materialize the page from its fragments.
We are friendly to cache by minimizing the 

The system is largely inspired by the Deuteronomy architecture, and aims to implement
the best features from RocksDB as well.
