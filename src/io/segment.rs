//! The `SegmentAccountant` is an allocator for equally-
//! sized chunks of the underlying storage file (segments).
//!
//! It must maintain these critical safety properties:
//!
//! A. We must not overwrite existing segments when they
//!    contain the most-recent stable state for a page.
//! B. We must not overwrite existing segments when active
//!    threads may have references to LogID's that point
//!    into those segments.
//!
//! To complicate matters, the `PageCache` only knows
//! when it has put a page into an IO buffer, but it
//! doesn't keep track of when that IO buffer is
//! stabilized (until write coalescing is implemented).
//!
//! To address these safety concerns, we rely on
//! these techniques:
//!
//! 1. We delay the reuse of any existing segment
//!    by ensuring there are at least <# io buffers>
//!    freed segments in front of the newly freed
//!    segment in the free list. This ensures that
//!    any pending IO buffer writes will hit
//!    stable storage before we overwrite the
//!    segment that may have contained the previous
//!    latest stable copy of a page's state.
//! 2. we use a `SegmentDropper` that guarantees
//!    any segment that has been logically freed
//!    or emptied by the `PageCache` will have its
//!    addition to the free segment list be delayed
//!    until any active threads that were acting on
//!    the shared state have checked-out.
//!
//! Another concern that arises due to the fact that
//! IO buffers may be written out-of-order is the
//! correct recovery of segments. If there is data
//! loss in recently written segments, we must be
//! careful to preserve linearizability in the log.
//! To do this, we must detect "torn segments" that
//! were not able to be fully written before a crash
//! happened. We detect torn individual segments by
//! writing a `SegmentTrailer` to the end of the
//! segment AFTER we have sync'd it. If the trailer
//! is not present during recovery, the recovery
//! process will not continue to a segment that
//! may contain logically later data.
//!
//! But what if we wrote a later segment, and its
//! trailer, before we were able to write its
//! immediate predecessor segment, and then a
//! crash happened? We must preserve linearizability,
//! so we can not accidentally recover the later
//! segment when its predecessor was lost in the crash.
//!
//! 3. This case is solved again by having used
//!    <# io buffers> segments before reuse. We guarantee
//!    that the last <# io buffers> segments will be
//!    present, which means we can write a "previous
//!    log sequence number pointer" to the header of
//!    each segment. During recovery, if these previous
//!    segment Lsn pointers don't match up, we know we
//!    have encountered a lost segment, and we will not
//!    continue the recovery past the detected gap.
